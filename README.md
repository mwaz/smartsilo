This is an IoT hardware based application on smart ways to monitor and manage silos through an integrated technology.
the technology involves the use of sensors to measure different elements such as temperatures, humidity and pressure. 
The setup is composed of an Arduino board, different sensors and wifi module to relay the sensor data to the cloud. 
Thingspreak API and matlab has been used extensively in the development of this application
